                    (hereinafter referred to as "the Application"), you, the user, hereby
                    acknowledge, agree, and irrevocably bind yourself to the following terms and
                    conditions, which govern your use of the Application, including but not limited
                    to the accumulation of points, conversion of points into Rwandan currency,
                    referral activities, and compliance with the rules and regulations set forth
                    herein. Failure to adhere to these terms and conditions may result in the
                    suspension, deletion, or permanent removal of your account, forfeiture of all
                    accumulated points, and other punitive measures as deemed necessary by the
                    system administrators or owners.

                            <br />
                            The Application operates on a {siteConfig.name} model, whereby users
                            accumulate points by performing designated tasks, including but not
                            limited to clicking on advertisements, completing surveys, or engaging
                            with sponsored content. These points are subsequently converted into
                            Rwandan currency (RWF) through a system-determined points divider, the
                            value of which is subject to change at the sole discretion of the
                            Application's owners. The conversion rate, frequency of conversion, and
                            availability of conversion are not guaranteed and may be modified,
                            suspended, or terminated without prior notice.

                            not limited to the use of automated clicking software, bots, scripts, or

                            prohibited. Users found engaging in such activities will be subject to
                            immediate account suspension, deletion, or permanent removal. All points
                            accumulated by the user, whether converted or unconverted, will be
                            forfeited, and no refunds or compensations will be provided under any

                            the sole discretion of the owners. The owners reserve the right to
                            modify, update, or discontinue any aspect of the Application, including
                            but not limited to the points system, conversion rates, withdrawal
                            mechanisms, and recipient payment methods. Users acknowledge and agree

                            bear no responsibility for any loss, inconvenience, or damage arising
                            from such modifications or discontinuations.

                            <br />
                            Users are eligible to withdraw their accumulated earnings only if they
                            have successfully referred and maintained at least two (2) active
                            downlines, each of whom must have purchased a paid package within the
                            Application. The default free package does not qualify as a valid
                            downline for withdrawal purposes. Users who fail to meet this
                            requirement will be unable to initiate or complete withdrawal requests,
                            regardless of their point balance or account activity.

                            <br />
                            Users may purchase packages within the Application to enhance their
                            earning potential or unlock additional features. However, all package
                            purchases are subject to approval by the system administrators. Users
                            must await explicit approval before utilizing any purchased package. If
                            a user deletes their account, engages in spamming activities, or
                            otherwise violates these terms and conditions while a package purchase
                            is pending approval, the user's account will be permanently blocked, and
                            no refunds will be issued.

                            <br />
                            In the event that a user deletes their account or engages in spamming
                            activities while a withdrawal request is pending, the account will be
                            immediately blocked, and all pending withdrawals will be canceled. No
                            refunds or compensations will be provided for forfeited points, pending
                            withdrawals, or purchased packages.

                            <br />
                            The Application's earning model is predicated on both clicking
                            activities and referral efforts. Users who are unwilling or unable to
                            dedicate sufficient time to refer at least two (2) active downlines are
                            advised not to register or utilize the Application. The owners emphasize
                            that the referral component is integral to the system's functionality,
                            and users who neglect this aspect may find their earning potential
                            severely limited.

                            <br />
                            Users are required to complete tasks, such as following the Application
                            on social media platforms, in good faith and without misrepresentation.
                            Any attempt to falsely claim task completion, provide misleading
                            information, or otherwise manipulate the task system will result in the
                            permanent blocking of the user's account. No appeals or reinstatements
                            will be permitted in such cases.

                            The Application operates on a strict no-refund policy, except in cases
                            where the owners, at their sole discretion, choose to issue a refund.
                            Users acknowledge and agree that all purchases, including but not
                            limited to packages and premium features, are non-refundable under
                            normal circumstances.

                            account information remains accurate and up-to-date. The owners bear no
                            responsibility for any loss or inconvenience arising from changes to
